##  public directory
  -The public/ directory is the default location where Laravel serves static assets like images. 
  _it contains the index.php file, which is the entry point for all requests entering your application and configures autoloading. This directory also houses your assets such as images, JavaScript, and CSS.
    
## dangers of not using  public directory
  _ attackers can download your source code , .env file ,configuration files, logs
  _ user-uploaded files in storage or cached views, can be directly accessed if the root directory is exposed.
